# Number Guessing Game (C++)

A beginner-friendly number guessing game written in C++ that challenges the user to guess a randomly selected number within a randomly generated range.

## Features

- Randomly chooses a lower and upper bound (e.g., 12 to 84)
- Picks a secret number within that range
- Takes user guesses as input
- Provides hints: too high / too low
- Counts total attempts
- Uses functions to keep the code clean and modular
- Validates if guess is within range
